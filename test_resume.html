					<h1>Personal Profile</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>Neurological function underlies all forms of human performance. Whether it is movement, sensory, or general cognition, everything starts with the brain. Despite its importance, much is still unknown about how these functions are accomplished or, more importantly, how we can improve them.  I use a combination of neuroimaging and neuromodulation techniques to improve neurological function in healthy populations and to treat neurological conditions in clinical populations.  My current research focuses on understanding the interaction between gaze behavior and gait during locomotor learning in healthy and clinical populations.</p>
